# aboardly-client-node

Official Aboardly API library client for node.js

This library is generated by [alpaca](https://github.com/pksunkara/alpaca) and then modified by hand, hence why some things seem over engineered.

## Installation

Make sure you have [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed.

```bash
$ npm install aboardly
```

#### Versions

Works with [ 0.8 / 0.9 / 0.10 / 0.11 ]

## Usage

```js
var aboardly = require('aboardly');

// Then we instantiate a client (as shown below)
```

### Build a client

__Using this api without authentication gives an error__

##### Basic authentication

    username: 'api_key',
    password: 'api_secret'
});
```

__All the callbacks provided to an api call will recieve the response as shown below__

```js
// You can also omit the 'methodOptions' param below
client.klass.method('args', methodOptions, function (err, response) {
    if (err) console.log(err);
    response.code;
    // >>> 200
    response.headers;
    // >>> {'x-server': 'apache'}
}
```

## Customers api

#### Create/Update customer (PUT customers/:customerId)

```js
client.customers.upsert("customer_id", options, callback);
```

## Events api

#### Create event (POST customers/:customerId/events/:eventName)

Creates a new event for a customer

The following arguments are required:

 * __customer_id__: Customer identifier - an identifier that can 1:1 match to the user in your own systems.
 * __event_name__: Event name (e.g. logged_in, signed_up, added_funds)

```js
client.events.create("customer_id", "event_name", options, callback);
